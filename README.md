MotorBike-Scraper
=================

Demo: www.alexyy.com/scraper.html

Problem: Looking for used motorbikes from a few different sources.

Solution: Create a scraper which scrapes all the info from all websites and displays in a browser nicely.

Functions to implement: 
* Sort by cheapest price/day
* Send me a text if found a bike with price/day cheaper than a certain threshold (twilio?)
